Probably soon one of the translators on twn will open a task for this anyways.\n\nI suggest to do a new patch for this and a month after this was merged one could do a 1.0.1 release making sure that a lot of translations are already in.",

Or is this the new patch to which you are referring?\n\nI totally agree that a 1.0.1 once more translations are in would be good, since there were a lot of message changes in 1.0.\n\nI\u0027m waiting for somebody who knows translation syntax to review this to be sure I did it correctly.
